# Welcome to yet another corner of the web.

## I'm Oscar,

I run this site which mostly functions as a poor man's documentation of the things I've done and how to do them yourself. You may also find some thoughts and opinions of mine if that's something you're interested in.

I cover:

* FOSS Alternatives
* Self-hosting and it's benefits
* Anything I find interesting
* Guides to the above.
* My journey as a FOSS and SysAdmin enthusiast.

If you're interested check out my [blog posts](/blog).
